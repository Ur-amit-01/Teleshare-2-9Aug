"""
feedback.py — a lightweight two-way support channel with no commands
involved on either side.

  * Any private message from a non-admin user (text or any media) that
    isn't itself a command is forwarded (with Telegram's own "Forwarded
    from" tag) straight into every admin's DM, followed by a small header
    identifying who it's from.
  * Whichever admin swipe-replies to that relayed message (either the
    copied content or the header) has their reply copied straight back
    to the user who sent it.

The user <-> relayed-message mapping is persisted in the `feedback` DB
collection (see plugins/helper/db.py), so replying still works even if
the bot restarts between the user's message and the admin's reply.

IMPORTANT: relay_admin_reply runs in group=-1 (before every other admin
message handler, e.g. the file-upload flow in upload.py) but its filter
only matches when the replied-to message is *actually* a tracked feedback
relay — so it only ever intercepts genuine feedback replies and otherwise
gets out of the way, letting an admin's ordinary reply-to-something-else
(uploading a file, editing a setting, etc.) reach its normal handler
untouched.
