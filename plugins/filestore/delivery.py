"""
delivery.py — delivers the files behind a link code to a user.

Strategy:
  1. Copy every item straight from the backup channel to the user via
     copy_message / copy_media_group. This delivers a clean message with no
     "Forwarded from" tag, and albums are copied as a single grouped unit so
     they arrive exactly as they were sent.
  2. If a copy fails (message purged from the backup channel, etc.) fall
     back to re-uploading each item from its stored file_id — grouping
     consecutive items that share a media_group_id back into albums via
     send_media_group.
