"""
start_message.py — builds/sends the bot's "start" content: an optional
photo plus the start_text setting. Shared by:
  - plugins/filestore/start.py   (bare /start)
  - plugins/filestore/deletion.py (sent again after an auto-deleted file,
    in place of the old single "Get It Again" link button)

Kept in its own module (rather than inside start.py) so deletion.py can
import it without a circular import through delivery.py -> deletion.py.
