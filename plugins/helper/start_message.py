start_message.py — builds/sends the bot's "start" content: an optional
photo plus the start_text setting, with the NEET material list rendered
as inline buttons (instead of text links). Shared by:
  - plugins/filestore/start.py   (bare /start, and the "🔄 Get Files Again"
    button callback fired from an auto-delete notice — see deletion.py)

Kept in its own module (rather than inside start.py) so deletion.py can
import it without a circular import through delivery.py -> deletion.py.
